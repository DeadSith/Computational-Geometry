# Computational Geometry
This repository is implementation of 4 labs from Computational Geomtry course.  
The third lab is most interesting. It will be posted on separate repository later.  
Everything is written using C# and WPF.  
I use |n| for variable indexing in this readme.
# Lab 1
Demonstrate movement of 2 circles moving on same horizontal line. Circles stop moving after they collide. Include both unidirectional and multidirectional movement.
# Lab 2
Build fractal by formula: z|n + 1| = λz|n|(1–z|n|). Iteration stop when (x|k|)^2 + (y|k|)^2 > 5.  
This is basically another verson of Julia set.
# Lab 3
Weiler–Atherton clipping algorithm for any simple figure.
# Lab 4
Spinning octahedron by deleting invisible facets.
